# Config Package

Locates and parses a STAI configuration file into a config struct. If the `STAI_ROOT` environment variable is set, the config will be loaded from that location. Otherwise, the package will look in `~/.stai/mainnet`. [See the wiki for for more information on using the `STAI_ROOT` variable.](https://github.com/STATION-I/stai-blockchain/wiki/INSTALL#testnets)
